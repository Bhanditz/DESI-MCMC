% Use the following line _only_ if you're still using LaTeX 2.09.
%\documentstyle[icml2015,epsf,natbib]{article}
% If you rely on Latex2e packages, like most moden people use this:
\documentclass{article}

% use Times
\usepackage{times}
% For figures

\include{includes/defs}

% Employ the following version of the ``usepackage'' statement for
% submitting the draft version of the paper for review.  This will set
% the note in the first column to ``Under review.  Do not distribute.''
\usepackage{includes/icml2015} 

% Employ this version of the ``usepackage'' statement after the paper has
% been accepted, when creating the final version.  This will set the

%\usepackage[accepted]{icml2015}


% The \icmltitle you define below is probably too long as a header.
% Therefore, a short form for the running title is supplied here:
\icmltitlerunning{Model of Quasar Spectroscopy}

\begin{document} 

\twocolumn[
\icmltitle{A Stochastic Process Model of Quasar Spectral Energy Distributions}
% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2015
% package.
